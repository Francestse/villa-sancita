    <p>Villa Sancita is located at the end of a small laneway in the quiet villa of Junjunjan, only 5 minutes drive North of main street Ubud.   The villa faces an uninterrupted view of swaying coconut tress and verdant rice fields.  Life is unhurried in this peaceful rice-farming neighbourhood of Balinese families and traditional temples.  Yet within a short walk are signs of more modern times – a growing number of excellent warungs (local cafés) or dip down into the rice fields for a walk from ancient days.</p>
