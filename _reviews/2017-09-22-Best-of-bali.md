From the moment my friends and I stepped into the Villa, we fell soooo in love. Suparta and his staff are so welcoming and really want to make you feel comfortable. The house has so much charm, with the pool, the quietness and you're near a lot in Ubud. Definitely wish we could've stayed there much longer, but for the time we did, it was magical and memorable!
