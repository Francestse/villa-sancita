review: OMG, what a wonderful villa. This place is about 20 min walk to downtown ubud. Excellent location. When we got into the villa the staff greeted us with warm welcome and open hearts. We were well taking care of. It's amazing villa, the space is so clean and the staff were wonderful . I highly recommend to stay here when you visit Bali . I can not thank you enough for taking care of us.
