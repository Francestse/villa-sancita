We just spent 1 week at Villa Sancita and total bliss is what we experienced. Prior to our arrival, Santi, the house manager was absolutely attentive and responsive to all our emails including assisting us with planning our excursions during our stay (many times at better prices then what we found online)! Upon arrival, Wayan the house driver was waiting for us at the airport and by the end of the week we considered him a great friend. Always prompt to pick us up and never complaining for the endless stops we would request throughout the day.
