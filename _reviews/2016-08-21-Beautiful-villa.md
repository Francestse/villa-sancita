review: We recently spent 6 nights here, it was amazing. The villa is located a few kms from the main street in Ubud, far enough to be quiet but close enough to ride to town in a few minutes. There were several lovely warungs (made becik, warung bintang bali, akamana) on the same road which we ate lovely meals at and there is a good spa (ubud wellness spa 2) just a few metres down the road. Santi and her staff were impeccable and could not be faulted. They were so professional and helpful, available but not intrusive.
