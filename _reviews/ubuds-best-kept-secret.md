A place to unwind and relax in an architecturally stunning home. The open concept of the living room and dining room allows you to reconnect with nature in the comforts of your own home. Villa Sancita is the perfect destination to escape the hustle and bustle of every day life. The location is ideal as it is far enough from Ubud to enjoy the serenity of the rice fields yet within walking distance/ drive to Ubud center for some entertainment. The staff at the Villa are simply wonderful; customer service at its finest. They welcome you with a warm smile and are always available should you have a question or request. I have many fond memories of my stay and would recommend you book this Villa without hesitation.
