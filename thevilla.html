      <h1>About Villa Sancita, Ubud</h1>
      <h3>Villa Sancita was a dream come true for the owner, Anne Dee and her husband, Eric.  Sancita is translated as one of the three traditional karma beliefs where the good you exude is given back to you instantly.  We hope you will feel instant serenity when you step inside our villa.</h3>
      <h3>Staying in this pocket of Paradise, just minutes away from Ubud, offers you the best of both worlds.  You can enjoy the many hip cafes, traditional markets, unique shops and relaxing spas that line Ubudâ€™s village streets or retreat into the peacefulness of your private villa in the refreshing swimming pool overlooking the lush rice paddies.</h3>
