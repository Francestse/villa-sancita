review: >-
  We recently spent 6 nights here, it was amazing. The villa is located a few
  kms from the main street in Ubud, far enough to be quiet but close enough to
  ride to town in a few minutes. There were several lovely warungs (made becik,
  warung bintang bali, akamana) on the same road which we ate lovely meals at
  and there is a good spa (ubud wellness spa 2) just a few metres down the road.
  Santi and her staff were impeccable and could not be faulted. They were so
  professional and helpful, available but not intrusive.
