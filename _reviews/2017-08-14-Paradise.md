The most striking thing about the villa is the open side of the house onto beautiful rice fields that you can also appreciate in the Infinity pool.
From morning to night we felt pampered, peaceful and relaxed. The staff of this beautiful villa are discreet yet available for your every need, often before you realise them yourself! A fantastic location and perfect to explore Ubud and the rest of Bali we had a moving experience on this beautiful Island.
Not to be missed, a villa apart. From flowers on your pillow to mouthwatering meals, we had the holiday of gods!
