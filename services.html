      <h1>Your Own Private Cooks</h1>
      <h3>Our dining room seats 8 comfortably where your included breakfast is served each morning by our gracious staff.  If you want another meal in, our talented cooks are happy to prepare homemade Balinese dishes that are hard to find outside of traditional Balinese compounds.  We charge only for the actual costs of groceries plus a nominal service fee and government tax.  Depending on your menu, the costs of an average meal would be about USD 7-10 per person.</h3>
