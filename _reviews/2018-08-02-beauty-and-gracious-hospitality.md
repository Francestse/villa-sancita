Stunning architecture that makes you feel you are living in nature. No walls between you and the rice fields and swaying palms. But what makes is outstanding is the hospitality of Suparta and his staff. It really felt like 3 days of paradise.

We loved the open layout, which also means that a lizard or two may stop by to visit. This was totally cool with us, but if you are terrified of such things, it may be an issue. The bedrooms are all cozy and walled, so you are protected there. They also come with bed nets.

Absolutely loved our stay and will be back if we visit Bali again.
