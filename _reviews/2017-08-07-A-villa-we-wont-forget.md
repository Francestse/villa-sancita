Our first villa in Bali has not disappointed. Far from it, one of the best places we could have hoped for, made all the more memorable because of the amazing staff that looked after us. Tucked away in a convenient spot just 1.5 km north of central Ubud, its highly accessible to all the sites in the region. We had deliberately chosen Ubud to see the real Bali. For our family this was the perfect location with morning trips out, then poolside by 3-4 and then dinner most nights in central Ubud. They villa is beautiful, spotless and highly maintained. We wanted for nothing. Can't find a single fault with this place.
