review: We recently spent 6 nights here, it was amazing. The villa is located a few kms from the main street in Ubud, far enough to be quiet but close enough to ride to town in a few minutes. There were several lovely warungs (made becik, warung bintang bali, akamana) on the same road which we ate lovely meals at and there is a good spa (ubud wellness spa 2) just a few metres down the road. Santi and her staff were impeccable and could not be faulted. They were so professional and helpful, available but not intrusive.

We just spent 1 week at Villa Sancita and total bliss is what we experienced. Prior to our arrival, Santi, the house manager was absolutely attentive and responsive to all our emails including assisting us with planning our excursions during our stay (many times at better prices then what we found online)! Upon arrival, Wayan the house driver was waiting for us at the airport and by the end of the week we considered him a great friend. Always prompt to pick us up and never complaining for the endless stops we would request throughout the day.
