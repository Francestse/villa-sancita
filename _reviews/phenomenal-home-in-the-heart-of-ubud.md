By far, this home is a phenomenal representation of the beauty of Bali. The rooms are comfortable, the living spaces are eclectic but by far the open living space, infinity pool, and views of rice fields made this place magical. I also was impressed by the Villa Sancita team. We opted for a few meals at home and the food was delicious and flavorful. If you are looking for a home that epitomizes Ubud and provides tranquility - this is it!
