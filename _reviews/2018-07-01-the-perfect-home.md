Villa Sancita was one of the best Airbnb's I have ever stayed at! From the breath-taking views of the home, to the amazing and helpful staff, there was really nothing at all to complain about. The staff helped with any need or question we had. From renting scooters, transportation, to any activity we wanted to do they were ready to help. Our cooks made the most delicious meals and were extremely professional. The unique architecture of this home make the stay even better and enjoyable. I wouldn't have preferred to stay anywhere else than this beautiful home. You get your money's worth and more! I'd 100% recommend this home and will be back another time! Thank you Villa Sancita and the wonderful staff, it was such a pleasure to stay here.
